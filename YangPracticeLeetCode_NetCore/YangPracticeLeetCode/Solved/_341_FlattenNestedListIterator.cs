		/// Intuition
		/// 
		/// Reversing the lists to put them onto the stack can be an expensive operation, and it turns out it isn't necessary.
		/// 
		/// Instead of pushing every item of a sub-list onto the stack, we can instead associate an index pointer with each sub-list, that keeps track of how far along that sub-list we are. Adding a new sub-list to the stack now becomes an O(1)O(1) operation instead of a O(length of sublist)O(lengthofsublist) one.
		///
		/// The total time complexity across all method calls for using up the entire iterator remains the same, but work is only done when it's necessary, thus improving performance when we only use part of the iterator. This is a desirable property for an iterator.
		/// 
		/// Algorithm
		/// 
		/// This approach can be implemented as either one stack of pairs/ tuples, or two stacks with one for NestedIntegers and the other for indexes. The best decision for this is language-dependent. I tried both for the Java and found that attempting to put Pair objects onto a single stack doesn't work well because updating an index count requires popping and then reconstructing the entire Pair due to immutability (alternatives such as using.Length-2 Listss as pairs are possible, but I don't think ideal). Using two stacks is cleaner.

		/// If you've heard of Iterators, you might assume they're simply a way of iterating over indexed or finite data structures. 
		/// 
		///But actually Iterators have some interesting properties that make them widely useful for not only indexed collections (e.g. Array) and other finite data structures (e.g. LinkedList or HashMap keys), but also for (possibly-infinite) generated data. We'll look at an example of that soon.
		///
		/// we discard the current one and replace it with the item in the node after?

		///This means that if we're simply iterating a Linked List, and don't ever need to go back to the head, then we only need to keep one value around at a time.
		/// Another really interesting property of Iterators is that they can represent sequences without even using a data structure!
		/// 
		/// For example consider a range Iterator:
		/// <![CDATA[
		/// class RangeIterator:
		///     def __init__(self, min, max):
		///         self._max = max
		///         self._current = min
		/// 
		///     def hasNext(self):
		///         return self._current < self._max
		/// 
		///     def next(self):
		///         self._current += 1
		///         return self._current - 1
		/// If we simply converted this to an Array, we'd need to allocate a large chunk of memory if min and max are far apart. For the most part, this would probably be wasted space.
		/// 
		/// However, by using an Iterator, we can use features like for i in range(40, 20000000) while still retaining the O(1)O(1) space of classic for (int i = min; i < max; i++) style loops seen in other languages. 
		///
		/// ]]>
		///
		/// Our final property is one that we couldn't even do by copying values into an Array—handling an infinite sequence. 
		///
		/// An Iterator only provides two methods:
		/// 
		/// .next() This returns the next item in the sequence. You can't assume that this item actually "exists" yet, it might be created when you call .next(), or it might already exist in a data structure that you have an Iterator over.
		/// 
		/// Once .next() is called, it will update the state of the Iterator. This means once you've got a value from .next() you won't be able to get the same value again. Therefore, if you don't store or process the value you got from the Iterator then it's possibly gone forever!
		/// 
		/// .hasNext() This returns whether or not another item is available. For example, an array Iterator should return False if we're at the end of the array. But for an Iterator that can produce items indefinitely, such as our square generator above, it might never return False.
		/// 
		/// A further property of Iterators is that they provide a clean interface for the code using them. Without Iterators, Linked List's, for example, tend to be particularly messy, as the code for traversing them gets muddled within the application code. With an Iterator, the external code doesn't even know how the underlying data structure works. For all it knows, the data could be coming from a Linked List, an Array, a Tree, a State Machine, a clever number generator, a file reader, a robot sensor, etc.
		/// 
		/// Not having to deal with nodes, state, indexes, etc leads to clean code. We call this the Iterator Pattern, and it is one of the most important design patterns for a software engineer to know.
		/// 
		/// As shown above, with only two methods, we get a lot of benefit (e.g. infinite sequences) and increased performance (e.g. not expanding sequences like range into arrays). We also get a nice way of separating the underlying data structure from the code that uses it.
		/// 
		/// 重要   Time Space
		///
		/// Let N be the total number of integers within the nested list, L be the total number of lists within the nested list, and D be the maximum nesting depth (maximum number of lists inside each other).

		/// 
		/// We'll analyze each of the methods separately.
		/// 
		/// Constructor: O(N + L)
		/// 
		/// The constructor is where all the time-consuming work is done.
		/// 
		/// For each list within the nested list, there will be one call to flattenList(...). The loop within flattenList(...) will then iterate nn times, where nn is the number of integers within that list. Across all calls to flattenList(...), there will be a total of NN loop iterations. Therefore, the time complexity is the number of lists plus the number of integers, giving us O(N + L).
		/// 
		/// !!!!  Notice that the maximum depth of the nesting does not impact the time complexity.
		/// 
		/// next(): O(1).

		/// Getting the next element requires incrementing position by 1 and accessing an element at a particular index of the integers list. Both of these are O(1) operations.
		/// 
		/// hasNext(): O(1).
		/// 
		/// Checking whether or not there is a next element requires comparing the length of the integers list to the position variable. This is an O(1) operation.

		/// Space complexity : O(N + D).
		/// 
		/// The most obvious auxiliary space is the integers list. The length of this is O(N).
		/// 
		/// The less obvious auxiliary space is the space used by the flattenList(...) function. Recall that recursive functions need to keep track of where they're up to by putting stack frames on the runtime stack. Therefore, we need to determine what the maximum number of stack frames there could be at a time is. Each time we encounter a nested list, we call flattenList(...) and a stack frame is added. Each time we finish processing a nested list, flattenList(...) returns and a stack frame is removed. Therefore, the maximum number of stack frames on the runtime stack is the maximum nesting depth, D.
